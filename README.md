# Object-Detection

Object detection is a technique that uses neural networks to localize and classify objects in images. This computer vision task has a wide range of applications, from medical imaging to self-driving cars.
Object detection is a computer vision task that aims to locate objects in digital images. As such, it is an instance of artificial intelligence that consists of training computers to see as humans do, specifically by recognizing and classifying objects according to semantic categories.1 Object localization is a technique for determining the location specific objects in an image by demarcating the object through a bounding box. Object classification is another technique that determines to which category a detected object belongs. The object detection task combines subtasks of object localization and classification to simultaneously estimate the location and type of object instances in one or more images.

Computer vision tasks
Object detection overlaps with other computer vision techniques, but developers nevertheless treat it as a discrete endeavor.

Image classification (or image recognition) aims to classify images according to defined categories. A rudimentary example of this is CAPTCHA image tests, in which a group of images may be organized as images with stop signs and images without. Image classification assigns one label to a whole image.

Object detection, by comparison, delineates individual objects in an image according to specified categories. While image classification divides images among those that have stop signs and those that do not, object detection locates and categorizes all of the road signs in an image, as well as other objects such as cars and people.

Image segmentation (or semantic segmentation) is similar to object detection, albeit more precise. Like object detection, segmentation delineates objects in an image according to semantic categories. But rather than mark objects using boxes, segmentation demarcates objects at the pixel level.

How object detection works
Understanding object detectionâ€™s inner machinations requires a foundation in computer vision and digital image processing more broadly. This section provides a general overview.

Image processing
In computer vision, images are expressed as continuous functions on a 2D coordinate plane represented as f(x,y). When digitized, images undergo two primary processes called sampling and quantization, which, in short, together convert the continuous image function into a discrete grid structure of pixel elements. The computer can then segment an image into discrete regions according to visual similarity and proximity of pixels.

By labeling images using an annotation interface, users define a specific object as a region of specific pixel-level features (for example, area, gray-value, and so on). When given an input image, the object detection model recognizes regions with similar features to those defined in the training dataset as the same object. In this way, object detection is a form of pattern recognition. Object detection models do not recognize objects per se, but rather aggregates of properties such as size, shape, color, and so on, and classify regions according to visual patterns inferred from manually annotated training data.4

An object detection model for a self-driving car, for example, does not recognize pedestrians but a set of features that form the general pattern characterizing pedestrian objects (as defined in the training data).

Model architecture
While different model families use different architectures, deep learning models for object detection follow a general structure. They consist of a backbone, neck, and head.

The backbone extracts features from an input image. Often, the backbone is derived from part of a pretrained classification model. The feature extraction produces a myriad feature maps of varying resolutions that the backbone passes to the neck. This latter portion of the structure concatenates the feature maps for each image. The architecture then passes the layered feature maps to the head, which predicts bounding boxes and classification scores for each feature set.

Two-stage detectors separate object localization and classification in the head, while single-stage detectors combine these tasks. The former generally return higher localization accuracy while the latter perform more quickly.
